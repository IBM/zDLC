As AI adoption accelerates across enterprise workloads, moving AI solutions from prototype to production presents a range of technical challenges. These include ensuring secure and efficient data access, meeting performance SLAs, enforcing model governance policies, and implementing robust monitoring and observability capabilities. A significant portion of these challenges stem from the mismatch between the environments used for AI model development and training versus those used for deployment. AI solution development often occurs in flexible, unconstrained environments, while production systems must adhere to strict operational, compliance, and infrastructure constraints.

IBM Z’s AI strategy addresses this by enabling model development and training on any platform—whether on IBM Z or external environments such as cloud-based AI services. This flexibility allows teams to leverage existing toolchains and infrastructure investments. Once models are trained, IBM Z provides a streamlined path for deployment, offering seamless portability onto IBM Z. This ensures that AI workloads can be integrated into mission-critical systems with the performance, reliability, and security that enterprise environments demand.
